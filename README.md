# Artisan â€” Google Apps Studio

This is a small React + Vite starter for *Artisan*, a company that builds Google Workspace add-ons, Apps Script automations, and Sheets integrations.

Quick start

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

2. Run the dev server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open the URL printed by Vite (usually http://localhost:5173).

Build for production:

```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```

Notes

- This is intentionally minimal: add TypeScript, tests, and deployment config as next steps.
- The example contact email is a placeholder: replace with your actual contact details.
